# A Relay Server

The `relay-server` is an HTTP service that has two functions:

- Accepting messages and storing all of them. `POST` method. 
  For example, `curl 'http://127.0.0.1:9776' -X POST -d 'message'`. 
- Returning the messages in the same order as received for each client. 
  For example, `curl 'http://127.0.0.1:9776/?id=alice'`. 

## Installation (optional)

```sh
cargo install relay-server --git https://github.com/Trust-Machines/core-eng
```

## Start the `relay-server` server

Run

```sh
cargo run relay-server 
```

from the root of the repository, or

```

```

if the `relay-server` is installed.

The default address is `http://127.0.0.1:9776`.

## Integration Test

1. Start the server `cargo run relay-server`
2. Run [./test.sh](./test.sh) in another terminal.
3. Close the server using `Ctrl+C`.
